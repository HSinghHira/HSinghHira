So, you wanna build a slick React app with Tailwind and Vite? Good choice.
Here’s your _no-BS, step-by-step_ setup guide. Let’s goooo 🧑‍💻💨

### 🥖 Install Bun _(Only Once)_

Because who doesn't want to install something called "bun"? 🍞
Run this in PowerShell and _poof_ — Bun is yours.

```powershell
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

### 🌍 Install the CLI tool globally _(Also Only Once)_

This little gem sets up the whole Vite + Tailwind + React magic.
Install it globally like the boss you are:

```powershell
bun install -g vite-tailwind-react-setup
```

### 🧙‍♂️ Setup Your App

Time to conjure your new React app out of thin air.
Just run this — no need for weird rituals.

```powershell
new-react-app
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies

You’ve got the project. Now let’s feed it some packages.
(Think of it like a software Happy Meal 🍔)

```powershell
bun install
```

### 💻 Run the App

Now launch that bad boy in dev mode and see the magic happen. ✨

```powershell
bun run dev
```

### 🎉 Boom! You're Up and Running

That’s it. You’ve officially entered dev mode.
Time to break things, fix things, and maybe even build something cool. 😎
