Back in 2016, before I moved to New Zealand 🇳🇿, I decided to challenge myself with a lil’ side project 💻.

At the time, _“Dekh Bhai”_ memes were EVERYWHERE in India — if you know, you know 😎.

(_Dekh Bhai_ = “Look, brother” for my non-desi friends 👀🧔)

So I thought, why not try building something around it? I was just learning JavaScript and wanted to turn the memes into a fun web app.

Spoiler alert: it took me a whole month to build 😅 (yes, I was a total beginner).

The project was built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no fancy stacks, just good old basics 🔧🧱

For styling, I used my comfort blanket — Bootstrap 🧶.

At that point, I had already used it in most of my mini projects, and it made responsive design way easier 📱💻

I also threw in Normalize.css by Nicolas Gallagher to make sure the site didn’t look like a mess on different browsers 🧹🖥️

For turning text into image (yup, like meme magic 🧙‍♂️✨), I used Fabric.js — a super handy HTML5 canvas library with all kinds of cool interactive features.

It even supports SVG-to-canvas conversions, which made things feel extra pro 💼

Changing text colors? That was powered by Prism.js by Lea Verou 🌈

(Technically meant for syntax highlighting, but hey, we adapt 😎)

For the character selection box on the side, I used nanoScroller.js by James F.

Think Mac-style scrollbars, but for us mere mortals 🖱️🍏

Picking colors was made easy with JSColor.js by Jan Odvarko — a cute little color picker that just worked 🎨👌

And lastly, I tried to make things social by using socialShare.js by Ritesh Kumar — sadly, it’s now deprecated (RIP 🪦), but it used to let you control social buttons like a boss.

Of course, holding all this together was good ol’ jQuery v2.1.0. A classic. Can’t forget the OG 💾💙

Moral of the story? I started small, learned a ton, and had a blast building something people could actually use (and laugh at 😄).

Still one of my fav beginner projects to date 💯
