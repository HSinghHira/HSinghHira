Hey there, tech enthusiasts! ðŸ“± Today, I want to share with you another exciting story from my journey as a developer. This time, it's all about creating a static website using the powerful Google Custom Search script for searching Apple's iOS Shortcuts. So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the world of web development!

When I embarked on this project, my goal was clear: to create a website with a simple design that would provide an efficient way to search for Apple's iOS Shortcuts. I opted for a straightforward design without delving too much into complex CSS. The result? A website that wasn't bad looking, but perhaps not the most visually striking. ðŸ˜…

Creating this website turned out to be an incredibly easy project, thanks to the magic of Google Custom Search. All I had to do was add the iOS Shortcut directories' websites to the Google Custom Search dashboard, and voila! The script provided a seamless search experience for users on my webpage. It was a breeze! ðŸ’¨
