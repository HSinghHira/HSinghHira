Hey there, folks! 🍕 Today, I want to share with you an incredible story from my time working at Domino's Pizza. It all started with a simple task: putting dough tags on newly made dough batches. It was a crucial health and safety requirement, and I hope they still follow it. But little did I know that this experience would lead me down a rabbit hole of Excel wonders. 🎩💻

One day, during a not-so-busy shift, I couldn't help but notice that the dough tags we were using weren't exactly visually appealing. You know, they lacked that wow factor. 🤔 So, when I got home, I decided to fire up Excel on my laptop to see if I could create better-looking tags. A quick Google search for inspiration, and voila! I had some good-looking tags ready to go. 🏷️🌟

But then, it hit me. I would still have to manually enter all the details for each tag. 🙇‍♀️ Determined to find a solution, I hit the search button once again and stumbled upon the magnificent world of Macros and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications for full, I know fancy name 😑). 🚀

With newfound knowledge, I started with a simple file. It was nothing fancy, just a basic automation to ease the manual data entry process. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of an exciting journey. Every step of the way, I continued to develop and improve my Excel project. 📈

In the end, I created something truly remarkable. If you're curious to see the different versions I released, head over to the GitHub repository. Unfortunately, I must confess that I no longer remember the password for the VBA, so you won't be able to view the codes behind the magic. 🧙‍♂️ (maybe decrypt the file and tell me the password too 🤣)

This project is a true testament to the wonders of Excel and VBA. Despite not remembering much about VBA or even how to perform simple calculations in Excel, I somehow managed to create this masterpiece. It's like a puzzle I solved without remembering how I did it. 🧩💡

And guess what? If the need arises, I can create an even better Excel project than this one. Trust me, the possibilities are endless! 💪

So there you have it, my extraordinary Excel adventure at Domino's Pizza. Who would have thought that a simple task like dough tags would lead me down the path of Excel wizardry? 🌟✨

Never underestimate the power of a curious mind and the vast capabilities of Microsoft Excel. Remember, with a little creativity and the right tools, you can build a whole new software-like system right within Excel itself. 🚀💻

Stay curious, keep exploring, and who knows what other wonders await us in the world of spreadsheets! 🌈📊
