![Meme Creator - PHP Based](assets/20250720_172606_dekh-bhai-meme-creator.png)

Okay this is kinda funny... but yep, I actually made _another_ Dekh Bhai Meme Creator back in 2016 😂

It was school days, Dekh Bhai memes were popping off in India, and apparently I couldn’t get enough of them. So I built a second version — because why not?

I already talked about the first one in my older blog post (built with good ol’ JavaScript), but this time I decided to switch things up and write the whole thing in PHP 💻🐘

It was a fun little experiment and honestly, I learned a bunch about PHP along the way.

There’s no live demo for this one (RIP hosting 😅), but the code’s chilling on GitHub if you're curious! 🛠️📂

But there are the Codes 🧑‍💻:

- Simple PHP file Github Gist: [https://gist.github.com/HSinghHira/...](https://gist.github.com/HSinghHira/7094b6285aa017def77e664c75230975)
- Full PHP Script: [https://github.com/HSinghHira/Dekh-Bhai-Meme-Creator/](https://github.com/HSinghHira/Dekh-Bhai-Meme-Creator/)
